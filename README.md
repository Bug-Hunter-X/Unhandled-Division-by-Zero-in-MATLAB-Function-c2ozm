This repository contains a MATLAB function with a potential division by zero error and its solution.  The `bug.m` file demonstrates the issue, where the function doesn't explicitly handle the case where the input `x` is 0, leading to a warning. The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version that addresses this problem using an `if` statement to check for the zero input, avoiding the division by zero error and providing a more robust function.
